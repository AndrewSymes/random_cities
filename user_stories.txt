As Max, 
I want to see the local conditions of a random city, 
so I can 
imagine what it would like to be there.

As Sascha, 
I want to view a simple summary of my local weather conditions, 
so I can 
get and idea of what the weather is like outside. 

As a Andrew, 
I want to view a map and click on cities, 
so I can 
imagine what it would like to be somewhere else.
